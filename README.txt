-------------------------------------

Use Generator.py to switch Threads.txt to either the pi or e input.

This code doesn't work.  Tries to use mutual recursion? to create 2 paths 
through the cubes.  Also tried to impliment multi-threading but need to
rework some structure in order to work properly (seperate threads entirly).
